	<ul>
		<li>User Login and Session Cookies</li>

	<a href="https://offscript.github.io/Keating-Cafe/" target="_blank"><h2>Keating's Tech Cafe</h2></a>
	<p>A project for the fictional Keating Technology Cafe, your typical coffee shop with a developer's twist. Constructed with Twitter's Bootstrap, the divs, with the exception of the Google Maps API plugin are added on page load with jQuery. On hover the divs display in a nice "hacker"-themed green, black, and white. </p>

	<a href="https://offscript.github.io/infinite_scroll/" target="_blank"><h2>Infinite Scroll Movie Database</h2></a>
	<p>This project uses AJAX to retrieve JSON packaged information from http://www.omdbapi.com/ and then uses jQuery to dynamically create HTML for displaying the retrieved information. In addition to this I employ an infinite scrolling method that retrieves more information via AJAX when the user gets to the bottom of their window. Just press the browse button and get to scrolling through the database at your leisure.</p>
