	<h1>About Me
	<span id="icon" onclick="openNav()"><img src="../assets/add.png" height="25px" style = padding-bottom="3px" alt="Sidebar"/> </span></h1>
	<p>In the field of computer science and programming, I'm interested in machine learning, specifically clustering. I'm also interested in swarm behavior and intelligence.</p>

	<p>However, sometimes I'm not coding. When this is the case you can find me playing or watching the beautiful game, soccer. When I'm not coding or watching soccer, I'm playing the piano. Though trained in the classical tradition for 10 years, now I mainly stick to arranging Top 40 hits and howling along. When I'm not coding, or watching soccer, or butchering your favorite song, I'm journaling. I do this mainly because it would be unfair to make friends and family listen to me speak as much I'd like to speak. Fortunately, my journal has no choice. When I'm not coding, watching soccer, playing the piano, or holding my journal hostage, I'm probably sleeping, hanging out, or fielding job offers.</p>
